The name of our project is Restaurant Food Delivery and Pickup Software System (RFPDS). It is an online food ordering system for individual restaurant or especially food truck, which allows customers to get their food delivered to their door or takeout from a specific restaurant. Through this web application, customers can view the menu and pricing information. Also, they can select menu, change menu, add into cart and checkout securely.
